# Global Economy
We live in a world driven by the global economy. The industries and goods production tend to be made where the cost is the lowest.
Usually, it is closely linked with the people living in the production area. It is a balance between salary cost and expertise, skills.

Therefore, goods with low-skilled needs are produced where buying human time is cheap. High technology goods are produced where people are able to make it even if their skills are expensive.

Thus situations tend to:
  • centralize the know-how. People interested in a specific technology have to move to the area where the production is. In the same time, it becomes         difficult to improve local knowledge if your skilled people moved to another place. 
  • push salaries from top to bottom: if 2 localities have the same level of skill to produce a good, it makes sense to have lower salaries to incentive       industries to come. 
  • increase the transport distance: centralizing the production implies the need of dispatching the goods all around the world. It’s a nonsense in terms       of ecology and energy consumption. 
  • move most of the benefits to just a few investors. 
  
# Local Currencies
The Global Economy is not recent. It has been built for decades or centuries.
Consequently, some economists theorized a way to tackle the negative aspects of the Global Economy through local currencies.
Indeed, a currency used only in a small locality increase local trade exchanges and then, decrease the low salary pressure and improve the people skills there. It’s a weapon to bring vitality in a local economy.
Some of these currencies even had a liquid mechanism to tackle the hoarding which makes rich becoming richer. The idea behind it was to encourage trades and a living economy. Until now, the only way to make the money liquid was to tax the stagnant money. As always, taxes are not popular and can be rightly regarded as confiscation.
So, if the local currencies have so many benefits, why aren’t we using it in everyday life?
Actually, these currencies encounter strong resistance from people themselves. Indeed, we hardly give trust in a value that has been created from nowhere and from nothing. And finally, local currencies often look like Monopoly money…
So, local currencies, even if based on good ideas, have been a failure most of the time.
The weapon that could bring vitality in a local economy has always become no more than a toy.
